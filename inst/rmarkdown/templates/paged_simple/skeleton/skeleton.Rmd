This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. In particular you will want to update the `output` field to whatever format your template requires.

This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides. Ideally it should knit out-of-the-box, or at least contain clear instructions as to what needs changing.
Finally, be sure to remove this message!

> IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need, be they refugees, displaced persons or other uprooted people.

# Adding Charts {-}

To add plot, first familiarize yourself with the [`{iomthemes}` package](https://iom.github.io/iomthemes)

## Code Snippet {-}

Hereâ€™s a code block that generates a plot:


```yaml
\```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(iomthemes)

readxl::read_excel(system.file(
  "undesa_pd_2020_ims_stock_by_sex_destination_and_origin.xlsx",

  sheet = "Table 1", skip = 9) |>
  ## Getting clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  dplyr::rename("total.2020"="x2020_14")|>
  # Add ISO2 country code to identify the country level records
