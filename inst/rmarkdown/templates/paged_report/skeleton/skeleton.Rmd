# Introduction {-}

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to __plain text text documents__. This simplify a lot the design of any documents as the graphical design work is handled separately from content development.

The document you read now is actually built on a template that leverage the [R pagedown package](https://pagedown.rbind.io/). This is a good place to demonstrate special features that your template provides.

Using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), you can embed reproducible code within your report.

Hereâ€™s a quick guide to get you started.

# Configure Report {-}

This file is what a user will see when they select your template. Make sure that you update the fields in the yaml header. 

```yaml
---
title: "Data Report Series"
subtitle: "Writing Reproducible Report with RMarkdown"
abstract-title: "Self-paced Tutorial"
abstract: "V.0.1"
date: "`r format(Sys.Date(),  '%d %B %Y')`"
author:
  - name: Edouard Legoupil
    affiliation: Chief Data Officer
    email: ellegoupil@iom.int
```

You can update the `output` field to add covers images using the `front_cover` and `back_cover` parameters 

```yaml
output:
  iomdown::paged_report:
    # put the path to your cover image
    front_img:
    img_to_dark: false
```


Lists of tables and/or figures can be inserted in the document using the `lot` and `lof` variables in the YAML metadata. You also can customize their titles with the `lot-title` and `lof-title` variables. By default, theses lists are referenced in the table of contents, if any. You can use the `lot-unlisted` and `lof-unlisted` options to remove them. For instance:

A list of abbreviations is automatically built if the document contains at least one HTML `abbr` element.
```yaml
# Set  toc title, default none
toc-title: Contents
# Change to true to include list of tables
lot: false
# Set lot title, default: "List of Tables"
lot-title: "Tables"
# Change to true to include list of figures
lof: false
# Set lof title, default: "List of Figures"
lof-title: "Figures"
# If you include any <abbr> a list of abbreviations will be built.
# Set lof title, default: "List of Abbreviations"
loa-title: "Acronyms"
paged-footnotes: true
links-to-footnotes: true
# uncomment this line to produce HTML and PDF in RStudio:
#knit: pagedown::chrome_print
---
```

By default, the front matter is composed of the cover, the table of contents and the lists of figures, tables and abbreviations if any. The only difference between the front matter pages and the main content pages is the style of the page numbers.


```yaml
# uncomment this line to produce HTML and PDF in RStudio:
#knit: pagedown::chrome_print
---
``` 

# Add Content  {-}


## Document Structure {-}

Use the `#` symbol to create headers. The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the header. Add `{-}` to get your header indexed correctly


```yaml
# Header 1 {-}

## Header 2 {-}

### Header 3 {-}

#### Header 4 {-}

##### Header 5 {-}

###### Header 6 {-}

```

## Multiple column   {-}


To set up mutliple coumn use the following. Note that you can define in % the respective width of each columns.

```yaml
:::: {.col2 .col-ruler style="display: flex;"}  

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.left data-latex=""}

__Right Column__  

Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla
 
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


::: {.left data-latex=""}


__Left Column__   

Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla

:::

:::

::::
```


:::: {.col2 .col-ruler style="display: flex;"}  

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.left data-latex=""}

__Right Column__  

Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla
 
:::

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}


::: {.left data-latex=""}

__Left Column__   

Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla Blablabla
 

:::

:::

::::

## Infobox   {-}


Inforbox can be usefull to outline a specific piece of content within your document.

```yaml
::: {.bg-blue}

This is an infobox 

:::
```

::: {.bg-blue}

This is an infobox 

:::


## Format text  {-}


###  Emphasis  {-}
You can add emphasis to text using asterisks or underscores.


```yaml
Bold: **bold text** or __bold text__
Italic: *italic text* or _italic text_
Strikethrough: ~~strikethrough~~
**bold text**
*italic text*
~~strikethrough~~
```

Bold: **bold text** or __bold text__
Italic: *italic text* or _italic text_
Strikethrough: ~~strikethrough~~
**bold text**
*italic text*
~~strikethrough~~
 

### Lists  {-} 

Use dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) to create __unordered lists__.
```yaml

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
```


- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
  
Use numbers followed by periods to create __ordered lists__.

```yaml

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2
```

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2
   
    

### Links  {-}

Create links using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL: Inline links are useful when you do not want to show the full URL but an alternative text (because URLs are usually long and ugly). In Markdown, the link text is inserted in square brackets and the URL in parentheses:  
 

```yaml
[pagedown website](https://pagedown.rbind.io/)
```
``. On a website, the URL is hidden and replaced by the link text: [pagedown website](https://pagedown.rbind.io/). The user can interactively access the URL by clicking on the link. 

 

### Quote {-} 

Use the > symbol to create blockquotes.

```yaml
> This is a blockquote.  IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need, be they refugees, displaced persons or other uprooted people.
```

> This is a blockquote.  IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need, be they refugees, displaced persons or other uprooted people.   


### Footnote {-} 

The default behavior of pagedown is to render notes as endnotes because Paged.js does not natively support footnotes for now. However, we introduced an experimental support for footnotes. You can test it by including `paged-footnotes: true` in the YAML header of your document. 



### Page Break {-} 

There are two ways to force a page break:

- with the `\newpage` command (`\pagebreak` also works)

- using one of these two CSS classes: `page-break-before` or `page-break-after`\

For example, to force a page break before a given section, use:
```markdown
### New section {.page-break-before}
```


### Icons {-} 

The [Humanitarian icons](https://brand.unocha.org/d/xEPytAUjC3sH/icons) which are now part of the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/categories/humanitarian) can be used directly through the [`fontawesome`](https://rstudio.github.io/fontawesome/) R package.
 
```{r icon,  include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages('fontawesome')
## This is the default icon for Protection
fontawesome::fa(name = "hands-holding-circle", 
                height ="15em",
                fill = "#0033A0")
```

### Code {-} 

Use backticks to create inline code: 


```yaml
Code be displayed as `inline code`
```

Code be displayed as `inline code`


Use triple backticks to create code blocks.

```yaml
/```
Here we have inline code
/```
```

```
Here we have inline code

```
 



## Insert Images & Tables {-}


### Images {-}

Add images using an exclamation mark followed by alt text in square brackets and the image URL in parentheses.

```yaml
![alt text](url)
```


### Table {-}

To create table, you can either:

* Create tables from text that you define using pipes (|) and dashes (-) to separate columns and rows. below is an example


```yaml
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |
```

which will then be displayed as below: 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
| Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

* Create tables from the content of an R object using the `kable()` function and add caption as required. The table will be automatically registered within the `lot` list of table for the document.

```{r, test-table, include=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(iris[, -5]), 
             caption = 'An example table.')
```



# Adding Charts {-}

R Markdown added values comes with the capacity to embed R code chunks in your document. 

## Load Libraries {-}

Hereâ€™s a code block that load some required library:

```{r install, eval=TRUE, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE}
# Install CRAN packages
packages <- c(
  # A collection of R packages designed for data science, 
  #including ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, purrr, tibble, stringr, and forcats.
  "tidyverse", 
  # Provides tools for scaling data and formatting axes and legends in ggplot2.
  "scales",  
  # Converts country names and codes between different formats.
  "countrycode"
)
install.packages(setdiff(packages, rownames(installed.packages())))


# Load required packages
library(iomthemes)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(countrycode) 
```

## Code Snippet {-}

Hereâ€™s a code block that load a dataset:
  
  
```{r data, eval=TRUE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
data.mig <- readxl::read_excel(system.file(
  "undesa_pd_2020_ims_stock_by_sex_destination_and_origin.xlsx",
  package = "iomthemes"),
  col_types = c("numeric", "text", "text","numeric", "text",
                "text", "numeric",
                "numeric","numeric", "numeric", "numeric","numeric","numeric",
                "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                "numeric","numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", "numeric",
                "numeric","numeric", "numeric" ), 
  sheet = "Table 1", skip = 9) |>
  ## Getting clean variable names
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  dplyr::rename("total.2020"="x2020_14")|>
  # Add ISO2 country code to identify the country level records 
  dplyr::mutate( 
    origin.iso2 = countrycode::countrycode(
      location_code_of_origin,
      origin = "un",
      destination = "iso2c"),
    destination.iso2 = countrycode::countrycode(
      location_code_of_destination,
      origin = "un",
      destination = "iso2c")) |>
  # Filter out rows where 'origin.iso2' and 'origin.iso2' is NA (missing)
  # We do so to keep only country level records - filter out region subtotal
  filter( !(is.na(origin.iso2)) ) |>
  filter( !(is.na(destination.iso2)) ) |>
  # Group the data by country of origin
  group_by(region_development_group_country_or_area_of_origin) |>
  # Summarize the total number of migrants for the year 2020 & remove NA! 
  summarise(total_migrants_2020 = sum(total.2020, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  # Arrange the summarized data in descending order of total migrants
  arrange(desc(total_migrants_2020)) |>
  # Select the top 10 countries of origin with the highest number of migrants
  slice_head(n = 10)  

```


And then the code block that generates a plot:

```{r plot, eval=TRUE,  fig.height=6, fig.width=10, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
## and the plot
plot <- data.mig |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = reorder(region_development_group_country_or_area_of_origin,
                    total_migrants_2020),
        y = total_migrants_2020)) +
  # Define it as a bar chart and apply IOM color palette
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           ## Apply IOM color palette!
           fill = iomthemes::iom_pal(n = 1, name= "pal_blue"),
           width = 0.8) +
  # Flip the chart to make it more legible
  coord_flip()  +
  ## Format the labels for the x axis
  scale_y_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_number(scale_cut = scales::cut_short_scale())) +
  labs(
    title = "Main Countries of Migrant Origin",
    subtitle = "Highlighting the top 10 countries contributing to global
                migration | 2020",
    x = "Country of Origin",
    y = "Total Migrants (2020)",
    caption = "Source: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
            Population Division. International Migrant Stock (2020)") +
  ## and apply IOM theme
  iomthemes::theme_iom(grid = "X", axis = "Y", axis_title = "X")

plot
```

## Chunk Options  {-}
Code Chunks can be configured with various options to control their behavior and appearance.

Below is a comprehensive guide to the potential configurations of a code chunk in R Markdown. These options are specified in the curly braces after the chunk name, separated by commas.

- **echo**: Controls whether the R code is displayed in the output.

```markdown 
  - `echo = TRUE` (default): Show the code.
  - `echo = FALSE`: Hide the code.

```

- **eval**: Controls whether the R code is evaluated.

```markdown 
  - `eval = TRUE` (default): Evaluate the code.
  - `eval = FALSE`: Do not evaluate the code.
```  

- **include**: Controls whether both the code and its output are included in the output document.

```markdown 
  - `include = TRUE` (default): Include both code and output.
  - `include = FALSE`: Exclude both code and output.
```  

- **results**: Controls how the results are displayed.

```markdown 

  - `results = "markup"` (default): Display results as regular text.
  - `results = "asis"`: Display results as raw Markdown.
  - `results = "hide"`: Hide the results.
```  

- **message**: Controls whether messages generated by the code are displayed.

```markdown
  - `message = TRUE` (default): Show messages.
  - `message = FALSE`: Hide messages.
```  

- **warning**: Controls whether warnings generated by the code are displayed.

```markdown
  - `warning = TRUE` (default): Show warnings.
  - `warning = FALSE`: Hide warnings.
```  

- **error**: Controls whether errors generated by the code are displayed.

```markdown
  - `error = FALSE` (default): Stop execution on error.
  - `error = TRUE`: Display errors and continue execution.
```  

 

```markdown
# This plot will be 6 inches wide and 4 inches high
plot(cars)

```  

- **fig.width** and **fig.height**: Control the width and height of plots in inches.

- **fig.align**: Controls the alignment of plots.
  - `fig.align = "default"`: Default alignment.
  - `fig.align = "left"`: Align plots to the left.
  - `fig.align = "center"`: Center plots.
  - `fig.align = "right"`: Align plots to the right.

- **out.width** and **out.height**: Control the width and height of the output (e.g., plots) in any valid CSS unit.  
  

- **fig.cap**: Adds a caption to the plot.

```markdown
fig.width=6, fig.height=4 
fig.align='center',
out.width='50%', out.height='300px'

fig.cap='A scatterplot of the cars dataset'
# This plot will be centered
plot(cars)
```  

- **cache**: Controls whether the results of the code chunk are cached.

```markdown
  - `cache = FALSE` (default): Do not cache results.
  - `cache = TRUE`: Cache results for faster recompilation.
```  

- **tidy**: Controls whether the code is reformatted (tidied) before being displayed.
  
```markdown 
  - `tidy = FALSE` (default): Do not tidy code.
  - `tidy = TRUE`: Tidy code.
```  

You can combine multiple chunk options by separating them with commas.
 
```markdown
echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'
# This code chunk will not show the code, hide warnings, and produce a centered plot of specified size
plot(cars)
```  
 
To add plot, first familiarize yourself with the [`{iomthemes}` package](https://iom.github.io/iomthemes).
