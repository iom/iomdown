## Custom styles

Some custom styles can be applied using fenced div or direct inline styling: [This text will be blue]{custom-style="Blue"}.

Example of a **quote**:

::: {custom-style="Quote"}

"IOM works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, to promote international cooperation on migration issues, to assist in the search for practical solutions to migration problems and to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in need, be they refugees, displaced persons or other uprooted people.‚Äù

:::


Footnotes are also included and will be added automatically to the bottom of the page like the following ones. This is a footnote^[Text of the footnote], it can include anything and can also be stylized 

Example of **list**:

Lists also are automatic but they will need extra manual tweaking if you want to apply a more adapted paragraph style with less spacing. This apply for both ordered and unordered lists.

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3

## Tables

Tables will come with a default style. More advanced layout can be achieved using the [flextable](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/index.html) package. Like the lists there is a built-in paragraph style if you want to improve the look and feel of your tables.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tab.cap="Example of an Iris table"}
tail(iris, 8)
```
